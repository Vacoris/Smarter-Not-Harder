# Hide Desktop Icons

There may come a time when you need to hide the icons on your macOS, whether it's for a clean screen share during a meeting or for a screen recording. The following script, when executed, will toggle the Hide/Show state of desktop icons. This way, regardless of your need for a clean desktop, you can simply run the script and be done with it.

## Details

The included script is written in bash and utilizes macOS functionality to control how Finder displays desktop icons. The only requirement for this to work is that macOS allows for the execution of bash scripts.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
1. Navigate to the folder containing the script.
1. Type the following command and hit Enter:

    ```sh
    ./Hide_Desktop_Icons.sh
    ```

This will execute the script and toggle the visibility of your desktop icons.

## Automator Application

If you prefer not to use the terminal, you can create an Automator application on macOS to execute this script with ease.
